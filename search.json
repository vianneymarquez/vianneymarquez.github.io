    "text": "“She’s the next greatest thing in women’s basketball,” NBA legend LeBron James said about rising star JuJu Watkins after watching USC destroy UC Riverside with Watkins scoring 27 points in 29 minutes.\nThe top-ranked player in her recruiting class has lived up to the hype as her first season playing college basketball has ended nothing short of extraordinary.\nAs women’s college basketball is currently taking the world by storm, headlined by names such as Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, Watkins could prove to shine brighter than all of them over the next few seasons. For now, she takes the title of being the best college freshman player.\nLet’s look at some numbers to prove this. The first question we’ll ask is by rating, how much is Watkins averaging per game?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nboxscores &lt;- load_wbb_player_box(seasons = 2024)\n\ntopscores &lt;- boxscores |&gt; \n  group_by(athlete_display_name, team_display_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    games = n(),\n    average_minutes = mean(minutes, na.rm=TRUE),\n    average_points = mean(points, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  filter(games &gt; 10 & average_minutes &gt; 20) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(average_points)) |&gt; \n  top_n(15, wt=average_points)\n\njujupoints &lt;- topscores |&gt; \n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"JuJu Watkins\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=topscores, aes(x=reorder(athlete_display_name, average_points), weight=average_points)) +\n  geom_bar(data=jujupoints, aes(x=reorder(athlete_display_name, average_points), weight=average_points), fill=\"#990000\") +       coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"JuJu Watkins is right behind Caitlin Clark on the highest average points as a freshman.\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s not overcomplicate this discussion. Watkins should have the ball on most USC possessions if you want to win. Watkins is averaging 27.1 points per game. Last month, Watkins scored a program-record 51 points against Stanford and 42 points over Colorado. That is the most points scored by a freshman in a season and most points scored in a game by a player this year. She is one of two women college basketball players averaging 25+ points and players with multiple 40-point games versus top 25 teams. The first being Clark. However, Watkins surpassed Clark’s freshman mark (799 points) to be named the ONLY freshman in women’s college basketball history to have scored 900 points in a season.\n“We believe she’s the best [freshman] in the country,” USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said.\nSo, what does this say about Watkins shooting percentage compared to the top players in the nation?\n\n\nCode\nstars &lt;- c(\"JuJu Watkins\", \"Caitlin Clark\", \"Angel Reese\", \"Cameron Brink\", \"Paige Bueckers\", \"Kamilla Cardoso\", \"Aaliyah Edwards\", \"Te-Hina Paopao\", \"Saniya Rivers\", \"Flau'jae Johnson\")\n\nboxscores |&gt; \nselect(athlete_display_name, field_goals_made, field_goals_attempted, three_point_field_goals_made, three_point_field_goals_attempted) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(-athlete_display_name), as.numeric) |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    games = n(),\n    TotalFG = sum(field_goals_made, na.rm=TRUE),\n    TotalFGA = sum(field_goals_attempted, na.rm=TRUE),\n    Total3P = sum(three_point_field_goals_made, na.rm=TRUE),\n    Total3PA = sum(three_point_field_goals_attempted, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(FGPct = TotalFG/TotalFGA, ThreePct = Total3P/Total3PA) |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% stars) |&gt; \n  rename(Athlete = athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  select(Athlete, FGPct, ThreePct) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(FGPct)) |&gt; \n    gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    FGPct = \"Shooting Percentage\",\n    ThreePct = \"Three Point Percentage\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"JuJu Watkins is the only freshman nationally ranked.\",\n    subtitle = \"As most of these players move on, she will move up in the ranks.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Vianney Marquez  |  **Source:** wehoop: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Women's Basketball Data\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(FGPct, ThreePct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#990000\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Athlete == \"JuJu Watkins\")\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuJu Watkins is the only freshman nationally ranked.\n\n\nAs most of these players move on, she will move up in the ranks.\n\n\nAthlete\nShooting Percentage\nThree Point Percentage\n\n\n\n\nKamilla Cardoso\n59.4%\n100.0%\n\n\nAaliyah Edwards\n59.3%\n0.0%\n\n\nPaige Bueckers\n53.0%\n41.6%\n\n\nCameron Brink\n51.1%\n30.4%\n\n\nFlau'jae Johnson\n50.4%\n38.0%\n\n\nAngel Reese\n47.1%\n11.1%\n\n\nTe-Hina Paopao\n46.1%\n46.8%\n\n\nCaitlin Clark\n45.5%\n37.8%\n\n\nJuJu Watkins\n40.1%\n31.9%\n\n\nSaniya Rivers\n38.2%\n26.0%\n\n\n\nBy: Vianney Marquez | Source: wehoop: The SportsDataverse’s R Package for Women’s Basketball Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatkins’ average shooting and three-point percentage is at around 40.1% and 31.9%. One of the basic learning parts for a basketball player is to know what a great shot is versus a good shot. Watkins takes and misses a number of good shots and great shots. Her size, length, strength, and confidence are one of the main causes for her temptation to take as many shots as she does. As a reminder, she is still a freshman and has a lot still to learn about herself and her consistency, but she still brings so much to the table. She is the only freshman nationally ranked amongst the top players in the country because of her ability to take shots and create shots.\nBut what does Watkins do other than score to achieve her success in being the best?\n\n\nCode\ntopfreshman &lt;- c(\"JuJu Watkins\", \"Hannah Hidalgo\", \"Mikaylah Williams\", \"Taliah Scott\", \"Addy Brown\", \"Madison Booker\", \"MiLaysia Fulwiley\", \"Zoe Brooks\", \"Audi Crooks\", \"KK Arnold\")\n\ntopstacked &lt;- boxscores |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(-athlete_display_name), as.numeric) |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Assists = sum(assists, na.rm=TRUE),\n    Steals = sum(steals, na.rm=TRUE),\n    Rebounds = sum(rebounds, na.rm=TRUE),\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% topfreshman) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=-athlete_display_name,\n    names_to=\"StatType\",\n    values_to = \"Total\"\n  )\n  \nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=topstacked, aes(x=reorder(athlete_display_name,Total), weight=Total, fill=StatType)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#990000\", \"grey\", \"#FFC72C\")) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Athlete\", \n    y=\"Total\", \n    title=\"JuJu Watkins is the Pac-12 freshman of the year for a reason. \", \n    subtitle=\"JuJu Watkins proves to be a triple threat on the court.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Vianney Marquez\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScoring isn’t the only thing a player needs to be good at to be proven they are one of the best in the nation. A player also needs to be good at what they can do for their team such as rebounding the basketball and playing great defense. Watkins’ versatility is any coach’s dream. She is a threat on both offense and defense as she averages 7.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 2.3 steals.\nWatkins’ level of play got her noticed all around the world, and it is rightfully deserved. She is arguably the best freshman women’s college basketball has ever seen."
