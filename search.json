    "text": "“She’s the next greatest thing in women’s basketball,” NBA legend LeBron James said about rising star JuJu Watkins after watching USC destroy UC Riverside with Watkins scoring 27 points in 29 minutes.\nThe top-ranked player in her recruiting class has lived up to the hype as her first season playing college basketball has ended nothing short of extraordinary.\nAs women’s college basketball is currently taking the world by storm, headlined by names such as Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, Watkins could prove to shine brighter than all of them over the next few seasons. For now, she takes the title of being the best college freshman player.\nLet’s look at some numbers to prove this. The first question we’ll ask is by rating, how much is Watkins averaging per game?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nboxscores &lt;- load_wbb_player_box(seasons = 2024)\n\ntopscores &lt;- boxscores |&gt; \n  group_by(athlete_display_name, team_display_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    games = n(),\n    average_minutes = mean(minutes, na.rm=TRUE),\n    average_points = mean(points, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  filter(games &gt; 10 & average_minutes &gt; 20) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(average_points)) |&gt; \n  top_n(15, wt=average_points)\n\njujupoints &lt;- topscores |&gt; \n  filter(athlete_display_name == \"JuJu Watkins\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=topscores, aes(x=reorder(athlete_display_name, average_points), weight=average_points)) +\n  geom_bar(data=jujupoints, aes(x=reorder(athlete_display_name, average_points), weight=average_points), fill=\"#990000\") +       coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"JuJu Watkins is right behind Caitlin Clark on the highest average points as a freshman.\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s not overcomplicate this discussion. Watkins should have the ball on most USC possessions if you want to win. Watkins is averaging 27.1 points per game. Last month, Watkins scored a program-record 51 points against Stanford and 42 points over Colorado. That is the most points scored by a freshman in a season and most points scored in a game by a player this year. She is one of two women college basketball players averaging 25+ points and players with multiple 40-point games versus top 25 teams. The first being Clark. However, Watkins surpassed Clark’s freshman mark (799 points) to be named the ONLY freshman in women’s college basketball history to have scored 900 points in a season.\n“We believe she’s the best [freshman] in the country,” USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said.\nSo, what does this say about Watkins shooting percentage compared to the top players in the nation?\n\n\nCode\nstars &lt;- c(\"JuJu Watkins\", \"Caitlin Clark\", \"Angel Reese\", \"Cameron Brink\", \"Paige Bueckers\", \"Kamilla Cardoso\", \"Aaliyah Edwards\", \"Te-Hina Paopao\", \"Saniya Rivers\", \"Flau'jae Johnson\")\n\nboxscores |&gt; \nselect(athlete_display_name, field_goals_made, field_goals_attempted, three_point_field_goals_made, three_point_field_goals_attempted) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(-athlete_display_name), as.numeric) |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    games = n(),\n    TotalFG = sum(field_goals_made, na.rm=TRUE),\n    TotalFGA = sum(field_goals_attempted, na.rm=TRUE),\n    Total3P = sum(three_point_field_goals_made, na.rm=TRUE),\n    Total3PA = sum(three_point_field_goals_attempted, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(FGPct = TotalFG/TotalFGA, ThreePct = Total3P/Total3PA) |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% stars) |&gt; \n  rename(Athlete = athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  select(Athlete, FGPct, ThreePct) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(FGPct)) |&gt; \n    gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    FGPct = \"Shooting Percentage\",\n    ThreePct = \"Three Point Percentage\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"JuJu Watkins is the only freshman nationally ranked.\",\n    subtitle = \"As most of these players move on, she will move up in the ranks.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Vianney Marquez  |  **Source:** wehoop: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Women's Basketball Data\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(FGPct, ThreePct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#990000\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Athlete == \"JuJu Watkins\")\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuJu Watkins is the only freshman nationally ranked.\n\n\nAs most of these players move on, she will move up in the ranks.\n\n\nAthlete\nShooting Percentage\nThree Point Percentage\n\n\n\n\nKamilla Cardoso\n59.4%\n100.0%\n\n\nAaliyah Edwards\n59.3%\n0.0%\n\n\nPaige Bueckers\n53.0%\n41.6%\n\n\nCameron Brink\n51.1%\n30.4%\n\n\nFlau'jae Johnson\n50.4%\n38.0%\n\n\nAngel Reese\n47.1%\n11.1%\n\n\nTe-Hina Paopao\n46.1%\n46.8%\n\n\nCaitlin Clark\n45.5%\n37.8%\n\n\nJuJu Watkins\n40.1%\n31.9%\n\n\nSaniya Rivers\n38.2%\n26.0%\n\n\n\nBy: Vianney Marquez | Source: wehoop: The SportsDataverse’s R Package for Women’s Basketball Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatkins’ average shooting and three-point percentage is at around 40.1% and 31.9%. One of the basic learning parts for a basketball player is to know what a great shot is versus a good shot. Watkins takes and misses a number of good shots and great shots. Her size, length, strength, and confidence are one of the main causes for her temptation to take as many shots as she does. As a reminder, she is still a freshman and has a lot still to learn about herself and her consistency, but she still brings so much to the table. She is the only freshman nationally ranked amongst the top players in the country because of her ability to take shots and create shots.\nBut what does Watkins do other than score to achieve her success in being the best?\n\n\nCode\ntopfreshman &lt;- c(\"JuJu Watkins\", \"Hannah Hidalgo\", \"Mikaylah Williams\", \"Taliah Scott\", \"Addy Brown\", \"Madison Booker\", \"MiLaysia Fulwiley\", \"Zoe Brooks\", \"Audi Crooks\", \"KK Arnold\")\n\ntopstacked &lt;- boxscores |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(-athlete_display_name), as.numeric) |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Assists = sum(assists, na.rm=TRUE),\n    Steals = sum(steals, na.rm=TRUE),\n    Rebounds = sum(rebounds, na.rm=TRUE),\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% topfreshman) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=-athlete_display_name,\n    names_to=\"StatType\",\n    values_to = \"Total\"\n  )\n  \nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=topstacked, aes(x=reorder(athlete_display_name,Total), weight=Total, fill=StatType)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#990000\", \"grey\", \"#FFC72C\")) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Athlete\", \n    y=\"Total\", \n    title=\"JuJu Watkins is the Pac-12 freshman of the year for a reason. \", \n    subtitle=\"JuJu Watkins proves to be a triple threat on the court.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Vianney Marquez\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScoring isn’t the only thing a player needs to be good at to be proven they are one of the best in the nation. A player also needs to be good at what they can do for their team such as rebounding the basketball and playing great defense. Watkins’ versatility is any coach’s dream. She is a threat on both offense and defense as she averages 7.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 2.3 steals.\nWatkins’ level of play got her noticed all around the world, and it is rightfully deserved. She is arguably the best freshman women’s college basketball has ever seen."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Bronny James, son of All-Star Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, declared for the NBA draft while also entering the NCAA transfer portal. James has the build of a great athlete and is selfless offensively and defensively on the court that gives him NBA potential. But his first college season at USC was underwhelming. Before his first game, he suffered cardiac arrest and was hospitalized for three days. The fact he even was able to play this year was a miracle and shows how tough he is mentally. On top of that, his squad had a losing record and missed the NCAA Tournament entirely with James being statistically low too.\n“He should go back to school to develop at his own pace, or he risks getting lost in the shuffle, whether or not he’s playing with his dad,” said an NBA general manager.\nNow that we’re heading into summer, the big questions remain should James keep his name in the 2024 NBA draft, or should he stay in college another year?\nLet’s take a look at some numbers.\nThe first question we’ll ask and answer by rating, against all the freshman players who entered the draft, where is James ranked by points?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nplayers24 &lt;- read_csv(\"players24.csv\")\n\nfreshman &lt;- c(\"Bronny James\", \"Reed Sheppard\", \"Stephon Castle\", \"Isaiah Collier\", \"Jared McCain\", \"Rob Dillingham\", \"Cody Williams\", \"Ja'Kobe Walter\", \"Johnny Furphy\", \"D.J. Wagner\", \"Bobi Klintman\",\"Justin Edwards\")\n\nfreshman24 &lt;- players24 |&gt; \n  filter(Player %in% freshman)\n\nbronny &lt;- freshman24 |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bronny James\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=freshman24, aes(x=reorder(Player, PTS), weight=PTS))  +\n  geom_bar(data=bronny, aes(x=reorder(Player, PTS), weight=PTS), fill=\"#990000\") +       coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Players\", \n    y=\"Points\",\n    title=\"Bronny is averaging the lowest points\", \n    subtitle=\"The former USC player best bet is to stay another year in college. \", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Vianney Marquez\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith just six starts across 25 games, James averaged just 4.8 points on a bad Trojans team. This put him at the bottom of the totem pole against all the other freshman who have also entered the NBA draft. He’s not even that close to reaching their averages either. Based on just his points, his best bet is to stay another year to increase his shooting average.\nPoints aren’t the only thing scouts look for when choosing the right player for their team. They want someone who will positively impact their team in both offensive and defensive. So where is James again against the other top-ranked freshman?\n\n\nCode\nplayerswhoplayed &lt;- players24 |&gt; \n  filter(G &gt; 10 & MP &gt; 500) \n\nbronny &lt;- players24 |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bronny James\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=playerswhoplayed, aes(x=OBPM, y=DBPM), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=freshman24, aes(x=OBPM, y=DBPM), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=bronny, aes(x=OBPM, y=DBPM), color= \"#990000\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive box plus/minus\", \n    y=\"Defensive box plus/minus\",\n    title=\"James's impact is not even close to the rest of his class \", \n    subtitle=\"The former Trojan's performance needs to rise to be a first round draftee.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Vianney Marquez\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefensive Box Plus/Minus measures a player’s impact on a team’s defense. It is per-100-possession stat. James’s DBPM is at a 1.4, which is pretty good. He is a defense-first player. He can really disrupt an opposing team’s offense. This is very important to be in the NBA. On the other hand, his OBPM isn’t as good. It is at a -2.6. It seems like he was way too easy to defend and didn’t always positively impact his team offensively.\nSince James doesn’t always positively impact him team offensively, what does this say about his usage percentage and how does it compare to some of the highest ranked players right now?\n\n\nCode\nplayerswhoplayed &lt;- players24 |&gt; \n  filter(G &gt; 10 & MP &gt; 500) \n\nbronny &lt;- players24 |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bronny James\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=playerswhoplayed, \n    groupOnX=FALSE, \n    aes(x=`USG%`, y=Class), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 19.4) + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=bronny, \n    groupOnX=TRUE, \n    aes(x=`USG%`, y=Class), color=\"#990000\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x=24.5, y=\"FR\", label=\"Bronny James\")\n  ) +\nlabs(x=\"USG%\", y=\"Class\", title=\"Bronny's USG% is at a 19.4\", subtitle=\"LeBron James's son usage percentage isn't bad, but a little too low.\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Vianney Marquez\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage rate calculates what percentage of a team’s offensive possessions a player uses while on the court provided that the play ends in of one of the three results: field-goal attempt, free-throw attempt, or turnover. If you think about it, an average player USG% should be at a 20 percent. James’s USG% is at a 19.4. He is close and right in the middle of his class. This means he preferably likes to pass more than shoot. He is a selfless player or is it because a lot of his shots don’t go in, so he must resort to this?\nSuffering a heart issue that set back the start of his season while being on a losing team, would put James in a better position as a sophomore if he chooses to stay in college. There’s a lot to like about James and the way he plays. He could be a 3-and-D combo guard since his stats prove he is not selfish on the court. He could thrive on the right college team that could set him up for a better chance to be selected in the earlier rounds of the draft. As of right now, he should probably stay another season if he wants to see time on the NBA floor."
